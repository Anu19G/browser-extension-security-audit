# Overview — Suspicious Browser Extension Audit & Removal

This project documents the process of auditing and removing suspicious browser extensions from **Google Chrome (Windows)** and **Mozilla Firefox ESR (Kali Linux)** as part of my cybersecurity internship.

---

## Purpose
Browser extensions can enhance productivity, but they also introduce potential **security and privacy risks** — especially when they request broad permissions, come from unknown developers, or are no longer actively used.

The aim of this task was to:
1. **Identify** all installed browser extensions.
2. **Review** them for suspicious traits.
3. **Remove or disable** risky ones.
4. Apply **best practices** to maintain browser security.

## Methodology
The audit followed a **structured 5-step process**:

1. **Baseline Inventory**
   - Listed all installed extensions with name, version, ID, permissions, and source.
   - Captured screenshots for record keeping.

2. **Risk Review**
   - Evaluated each extension based on permission scope, authenticity, developer reputation, and usage necessity.
   - Searched online for any reported security issues.
   - Classified extensions into Safe, Medium Risk, or High Risk.

3. **Safe Removal**
   - Verified suspicion using **CRXcavator** and **Extension Source Viewer**.
   - Removed or disabled flagged extensions without breaking necessary workflows.
   - Cleared cache and verified removal.

4. **Best Practices**
   - Documented preventive measures to avoid future malicious extension installations.

5. **Outcome**
   - Screenshots and tables as proof of work.
   - Preventive security recommendations.

## Highlights
- **Advanced Tools Used**: CRXcavator, Extension Source Viewer.
- **Cross-Platform Audit**: Both Windows (Chrome) and Kali Linux (Firefox) covered.
- **Documented Process**: Every step clearly recorded for transparency.
- **Security Education**: Included a best practices guide for ongoing browser safety.

---

## Deliverables
- **PDF Report** with detailed steps, findings, and outcomes.
- **Risk Assessment Table** for all reviewed extensions.
- **Preventive Recommendations** section.

---

## Outcome
The final browsers now contain **only trusted, essential extensions**, significantly reducing the risk of:
- Data theft
- Unauthorized tracking
- Browser exploitation via malicious updates

This process not only secured the browsing environment but also provided a replicable model for future security audits.
